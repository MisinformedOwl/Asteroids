# Asteroids
A asteroids remake in python

This game is a in progress project where i will be creating an AI that will play the game.
This is simply a test, and allowing me to work with unsupervised AI learning.

# How to play
> The exe

So pyinstaller isn't working today apparently, therefore Imma take a break and look at this tomorrow.

The game has a exe uploaded onto github. launching this in its contained file with both sprites and fonts available to it should allow the program to run with no issues.

> the .py file

For this i used anaconda, with the IDE spyder.
If you do not already, since i haven't uploaded a .yml file for the environment you will need these libraries available:

- pygame
- random
- math
- time

Once these are available you can play it by launching the anaconda command prompt and type in...

```
  python game.py
```

# The basics of how to play
> Settings

When the game launches you will be asked how big you want the screen in pixels. the size of the screen has an impact on the difficulty in terms of maneuverability. 

> The controls

This game uses the typical wsad settings to move.

W: Move the ship forward
A and D: Turns the ship left and right respectivly.
S: Quickly grinds the ship to a halt.
