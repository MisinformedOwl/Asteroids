# Asteroids
A asteroids remake in python

This game is a in progress project where i will be creating an AI that will play the game.
This is simply a test, and allowing me to work with unsupervised AI learning.

# How to play
> The exe

Pyinstaller the library used to create exe files is not working. looking into how to fix this

> the .py file

For this i used anaconda, with the IDE spyder.
There is a yml file available for download. to use this you will have to import it to anaconda using either the terminal or the navigator

Once these are available you can play it by launching the anaconda command prompt and type in...

```
  python game.py
```

# The basics of how to play
> Settings

When the game launches you will be asked how big you want the screen in pixels. the size of the screen has an impact on the difficulty in terms of maneuverability.

- W: Move the ship forward
- A and D: Turns the ship left and right respectivly.
