# Asteroids
A asteroids remake in python

This game is a in progress project where i will be creating an AI that will play the game.
This is simply a test, and allowing me to work with unsupervised AI learning.

# How to play
> The exe

The game has a exe uploaded onto github. launching this in its contained file with both sprites and fonts available to it should allow the program to run with no issues.

> the .py file

For this i used anaconda, with the IDE spyder.
If you do not already, since i haven't uploaded a .yml file for the environment you will need these libraries available:

- pygame
- random
- math
- PIL (pillow)
- time

Once these are available you can play it by launching the anaconda command prompt and type in...

  python game.py
